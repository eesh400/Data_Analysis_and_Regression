# Data Analysis and Regression Using Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores core ideas in statistical data analysis using Python. The work focuses on understanding different types of data, dealing with common data quality issues, and applying standard statistical techniques such as clustering and regression. Throughout the notebook, clarity of explanation and clear interpretation of results has been emphasized.

## Purpose
The aim of this work is to demonstrate a clear understanding of how data is classified, cleaned, analysed, and modelled in practice. Rather than focusing on complex algorithms, the notebook prioritises sound statistical reasoning and well-structured analysis.

## Topics Covered
- Classification of data (nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio)
- Identification of dirty or incomplete data
- Handling missing values using imputation methods
- Exploratory data analysis through visualisation
- K-means clustering and selection of the number of clusters using the elbow method
- Simple linear regression
- Multiple linear regression

## Methodology
The analysis follows a logical sequence, beginning with data understanding and cleaning, followed by visual exploration, and application of statistical models at the end.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn
